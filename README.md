<h1>ChristmasTreeLightsPIC16</h1>
This is a little DIY project where I really wanted to recreate these icicle shaped christmas lights I bought a couple decades ago at Menards. The wire for the lights was so thin, they eventually broke after just a couple of years. I wanted to recreate the same lighting circuit, using a custom PCB and my favorite PIC microcontroller, while also adding additional lighting functions. This project also included the PCB design I made.
